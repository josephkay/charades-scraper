2014-07-07 17:38:21+0100 [scrapy] INFO: description: Christopher Marlowe was a 16th century English playwright.  He was the leading Elizabethan tragedian before Shakespeare.  His works are known for their overreaching protagonists and his use of blank verse.  Little is known about Marlowe's life, but there is much speculation about his possibly being a spy, homosexual, a heretic, magician and atheist.  The Tragedy of Dido Queene of Carthage is full of the Greek characters the reader will be familiar with.  Besides Dido the cast includes Jupiter, Hermes, Cupid, Venus and Juno.  Dido was the first queen and founder of Carthage.  Her story has been told in many ways.  Marlowe's drama is one of the best.

Dotted with the usual characteristics—dark forests, illusory palaces, enchanted islands, seductive sorceresses—Floridoro is the story of the two greatest knights of a bygone age: the handsome Floridoro, who risks everything for love, and the beautiful Risamante, who helps women in distress while on a quest for her inheritance. Throughout, Moderata Fonte (1555–92) vehemently defends women’s capacity to rival male prowess in traditionally male-dominated spheres. And her open criticism of women’s lack of education is echoed in the plights of various female characters who must depend on unreliable men.First published in 1581, Floridoro remains a vivacious and inventive narrative by a singular poet.
